# NOTE!
The code is not done. I will update it in the future. Furthermore, I do not take responsibility if you misuse the code. This was made out of fun and passion for programming only! Never it was meant to harm others!

# Menelaus_Malware
This is a disruptive malware coded entirely in Python. Obviously, for educational purposes only! As o f today: Sat. 23rd March 2024, the code works on Windows 11 and it does not get detected by Windows Defender. Keep reading the README file for more info about structure and whatnot :)

# Ethimology
This malicious software takes its name from Greek mithology.
In Greek mythology, Menelaus was a Greek king of Mycenaean Sparta. According to the Iliad, Menelaus was a central figure in the Trojan War, leading the Spartan contingent of the Greek army, under his elder brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae therefore the name Menelaus.

# Structure
Enough with history already! :)
Let's dive into the structure of the malware. Menelaus will, firstly, gather as much info as it can about your device (including STARTUPINFO), then it will check if python is installed on the target device, if not it will call the Powershell script "code.ps1" and it will install the latest python version on the targeted device. Once Python gets installed on the device, it will run the whole script as admin. Moreover, if it gets detected which it doesn't since the script starts by disabling warnings, Windows defender and monitoring any directories that might have any debugger or decryptor scripts,and it avoids detection. Meanwhile, it executes some "benevolent" code as any other softwares would and it will try to get root privileges. Once it gets root privileges and it realizes that has bypassed any detections it calls for bash "runner.sh" script which will run the script on all devices online on the subnet (of course it's gonna check for who is online and who is not. If not online then it will commit suicide - function name) and then it will finally inject some shell code into a process, it opens the notepad and an output will be printed which will say whether or not the notepad has been opened properly.

(If output says: notepad is open - then we know we have successfully injected code and bypassed security measurements) if it does manage to open the notepad, it then will execute the functions:"SetFiles()" [which will encrypt all files on the device], "init_damage()", "message()" and "beeps()" which will download another disruptive worm in ".zip" format from Github (credits to: thepiminer - r3ktvirus) with the "git clone" command and the code will be emitting several different Windows warning sounds for a few seconds at a high frequency.
Once the target device will have completed the download, it will silently (hidden process) extract the zip file and run it in the terminal, thus it will execute another virus inside of its own. Subsequently, it calls the function "replicate()" which will duplicate the script and save the new malware with name "menelaus2.py" in a directory on the target device - The directory will be stored and data will be overwritten so that the attacker (me) can keep track of the newly generated malware.

After this part is done, the malware will delete itself however before self-deleting it will look for outlook app, access it, check your inbox, detect which language the target device is in and which language are the emails in. Once detected the language, it will choose one random contact among the email contacts of the targeted person and create a fresh email with the new malware attached and send it to another random person (the subject and body of the email will not change - they are pre-written).

# The Disruptive Part
This is the final part of the virus. If the software were to execute the previous parts, now the malware will just delete every file that is on the kernel and then it will proceed to shut down the system.
