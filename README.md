# NOTE!
The code is not finished. I will update it in the future. Furthermore, I do not take responsibility if you misuse the code! This was made out of fun and passion for programming only! Never it was meant to harm others or never it was thought to be ruining others!

# OBSERVATION
I am aware of the fact that there is a "server.py" script. It is not integrated within the code just YET. I thought of coding this worm without a server since it will first encrypt then erase permanently all files from the kernel, so there wouldn't be a primary need. Anyhoo, when I will upload the finished version I will decide whether to implement a server script where you can have remote access. We'll see - I'm kinda lazy though :-), even if the server is fully coded to some extend and I would just have to set up a server from my terminal and write some more code in "menelaus.py".

# Menelaus_Malware
This is a disruptive malware coded entirely in Python. Obviously, for educational purposes only! As o f today: Sat. 22nd March 2024, the code works on Windows 11 and it does not get detected by Windows Defender. Keep reading the README file for more info about structure and whatnot :)

# Ethimology
This malicious software takes its name from Greek mithology.
In Greek mythology, Menelaus was a Greek king of Mycenaean Sparta. According to the Iliad, Menelaus was a central figure in the Trojan War, leading the Spartan contingent of the Greek army, under his elder brother Agamemnon, king of Mycenae therefore the name Menelaus.

# Structure
Enough with history already! :)
Let's dive into the structure of the malware. Menelaus will, firstly, gather as much info as it can about your device (including STARTUPINFO), then it will check if python is installed on the target device, if not it will call the Powershell script "code.ps1" and it will install the latest python version on the targeted device. Once Python gets installed on the device, it will run the whole script as admin. Moreover, if it gets detected which it doesn't since the script starts by disabling warnings plus Windows defender and it avoids detection. After that, it is going to be monitoring any directories that might have any debugger or decryptor scripts and in case it would get executed, our code will try and succesfully kill it; meanwhile, it executes some "benevolent" code and it will try to get root privileges. Once it gets root privileges and it realizes that has bypassed any detections it calls for bash "runner.sh" script which will run the script on all devices online on the subnet (of course it's gonna check for who is online and who is not. If not online then it will commit suicide - function name) and then it will finally inject some shell code into a process, it opens the notepad.

If it does manage to open the notepad, we execute the functions:"SetFiles()" [which will encrypt all files on the device - within the declared extensions], "message()", "beeps()" and "init_damage()" which will download another disruptive worm in ".zip" format from Github (credits to: thepiminer - r3ktvirus) with the "git clone" command (Obs: I have not thought of checking first whether the target has git installed - It would be a good thing to add onto the script!) and the code will be emitting several different Windows warning sounds for a few seconds at a high frequency.
Once the target device will have completed the download, it will silently (hidden process) extract the zip file and run it in the terminal, thus it will execute another virus inside of its own. Subsequently, it calls the function "replicate()" which will duplicate the script and save the new malware with name "menelaus2.py" in a directory on the target device - The directory will be stored and data will be overwritten.

After this part is done, the malware will delete itself however before self-deleting it will look for outlook app, access it, check your inbox, detect which language are the emails in. Once detected the language, it will choose random contacts among the email contacts of the targeted person and create fresh emails with the new malware attached (ideally PDF files or JPEG files) and send it to another random person (the subject and body of the emails will not change - they are pre-written - onlyl email addresses will be extracted and re-used by the virus).

# The Disruptive Part
This is the final part of the virus. If the software were to execute the previous parts, now the malware will decrypt files and delete them all. Finally, it will proceed to shut down the system. Why would I decrypt the files and then delete them? It's a virus, it is supposed to be trolling people :D 

# MISSING PART(s)
One major missing part is: the code when it repliactes, it does not configure itself to be a python "--onefile", meaning it does not configure to be an ".exe" app. Therefore, it should be done manually.
BTW, the update code that will follow up, it will contain this function! :-)
